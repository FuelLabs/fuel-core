/// An algorithm for calculating the gas price for the next block
///
/// The algorithm breaks up the gas price into two components:
/// - The execution gas price, which is used to cover the cost of executing the next block as well
///   as moderating the congestion of the network by increasing the price when traffic is high.
/// - The data availability (DA) gas price, which is used to cover the cost of recording the block on the DA chain
///
/// The execution gas price is calculated eagerly based on the fullness of the last received l2 block. Each
/// block has a capacity threshold, and if the block is above this threshold, the gas price is increased. If
/// it is below the threshold, the gas price is decreased.
/// The gas price can only change by a fixed amount each block.
///
/// The DA gas price is calculated based on the profit of previous blocks. The profit is the
/// difference between the rewards from the DA portion of the gas price and the cost of recording the blocks on the DA chain.
/// The algorithm uses a naive PID controller to calculate the change in the DA gas price. The "P" portion
/// of the new gas price is "proportional" to the profit, either negative or positive. The "D" portion is derived
/// from the slope or change in the profits since the last block.
///
/// if p > 0 and dp/db > 0, decrease
/// if p > 0 and dp/db < 0, hold/moderate
/// if p < 0 and dp/db < 0, increase
/// if p < 0 and dp/db > 0, hold/moderate
///
/// The DA portion also uses a moving average of the profits over the last `avg_window` blocks
/// instead of the actual profit. Setting the `avg_window` to 1 will effectively disable the
/// moving average.
