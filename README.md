# Codecov report pages

[View the reports](https://fuellabs.github.io/fuel-core/index.html)

The code coverage reporting CI workflow pushes folder for each tracked branch here.
Branch names are urlsafe-base64-encoded to avoid security issues and bugs.
Every time a PR workflow runs or the master receives new commits, a CI action pushes updated codecov report there.
