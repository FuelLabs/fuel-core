**You are about to explode the performance of our nodes ðŸš€ðŸš€ Be ready for the future...**

You will execute a block containing 150k TX. If you are on a Macbook Pro M3 it should take 1 second.
If you have even better machine try to explode our performance and share it on Twitter @fuel_network !

*This process is heavy make sure you have a limited of things running on your machine and focus on this run.*

## Running

You just have to run the binary : 

```
./high_tps_public_bench
```

Admire the journey to the moon ðŸš€ðŸŒ˜ and share your results online.

### I want more !!

If you are starving for more you can tweak the parameters of the binary to execute a block with even more or more transactions :
```
./high_tps_public_bench --number-of-cores 16 --number-of-transactions 150000
```

*These are the default values, try to maximize the number of transactions you can execute in 1 second to explode the numbers ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥.*
