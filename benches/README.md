# Fuel Core Benches
This directory contains a set of benchmarks for Fuel Core. The benchmarks are
used for calculating gas metering costs for the Fuel Core VM.

## Running the benchmarks
To run the benchmarks, you can use `cargo bench -p fuel-core-benches` command available.
Alternatively you can use `cargo criterion -p fuel-core-benches` if you have it installed.
For more information on using criterion see [the guide](https://bheisler.github.io/criterion.rs/book/).

## Profiling a benchmark
Sometimes it is useful to produce a flamegraph from a benchmark to verify
you are measuring the correct things.
To do this you can use the `cargo flamegraph` [command](https://github.com/flamegraph-rs/flamegraph).

### Benchmarking a specific function
First build the benchmark with debug symbols:
`CARGO_PROFILE_RELEASE_DEBUG=true cargo-criterion -p fuel-core-benches --no-run`
Then you need to find the actual test binary that was built:
`ls target/release/deps/vm* -lat | head -1`
Should give you something like:
`target/release/deps/vm-a17190f2ca5e7169`
Then you can run the benchmark with the `flamegraph` command (runs the bench for 10 seconds):
`flamegraph target/release/deps/vm-a17190f2ca5e7169 --bench bench_name --profile-time 10`
For example if you want to profile the `swwq` op you would do (it's regex):
`flamegraph target/release/deps/vm-a17190f2ca5e7169 --bench '^swwq/swwq$' --profile-time 10`
Or for a dependent bench you would do:
`flamegraph target/release/deps/vm-a17190f2ca5e7169 --bench '^srwq/100$' --profile-time 10`

## Using `collect` to generate bench data
Firstly you should run the benchmarks and collect the output:
`cargo criterion -p fuel-core-benches --message-format json -- --bench >bench.json`
You could just pipe the output into the collect binary but benches are slow to run
so I suggest saving the output like above.

Then you can run the `collect` binary to generate the data you want:
`cargo run -p fuel-core-benches --bin collect --release -- --input bench.json`
This will generate a `gas-costs.yaml` file in the current directory like:
```yaml
burn: 35
call:
  base: 311
  dep_per_unit: 14
```
There are multiple output options. See `collect --help` for more information.

### Generating the `fuel-vm` `default-gas-costs.rs`
Do the same as above except run the following `collect` command.
`cargo run -p fuel-core-benches --bin collect --release -- --input bench.json -f rust --output default-gas-costs.rs`
This will generate a `default-gas-costs.rs` file in the current directory like:
```rust
```

This file can then replace the one in `fuel-vm/src/gas/default-gas-costs.rs`.
