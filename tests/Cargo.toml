# Disable automatic test target discovery. This allows us to run all the integ tests as a single binary target (lib.rs)
# instead of each integ test file being its own compiled & linked binary which is the default behavior. Linking with
# RocksDB is expensive so we want to minimize the amount of work on ld. This is also how other projects like diesel-rs
# structure their integ tests.
