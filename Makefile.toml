# This is a configuration file for the cargo plugin `cargo-make`. We use this plugin because of it's handling around
# cargo workspaces. Specifically, each task is run on workspace members independently, avoiding potential issues that
# arise from feature unification (https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/features.html#feature-unification).
# Feature unification allows two unrelated crates with the same dependency to enable features on eachother.
# This is problematic when a crate is built independently (when publishing / being consumed from crates.io),
# and it implicitly depended on features enabled by other crates in the same workspace.
# While feature resolver v2 attempted to resolve this problem, it still comes up in certain scenarios.
