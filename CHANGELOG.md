## [Unreleased]

Description of the upcoming release here.

### Added

- [#1308](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1308): Add support for loading .env files when compiling with the `env` feature. This allows users to conveniently supply CLI arguments in a secure and IDE-agnostic way. 
- [#1263](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1263): Add gas benchmarks for `ED19` and `ECR1` instructions.
- [#1286](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1286): Include readable names for test cases where missing.
- [#1304](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1304): Implemented `submit_and_await_commit_with_receipts` method for `FuelClient`.

### Changed

- [#1314](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1314): Removed `types::ConsensusParameters` in favour of `fuel_tx:ConsensusParameters`.
- [#1302](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1302): Removed the usage of flake and building of the bridge contract ABI.
    It simplifies the maintenance and updating of the events, requiring only putting the event definition into the codebase of the relayer.
- [#1293](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/issues/1293): Parallelized the `estimate_predicates` endpoint to utilize all available threads.
- [#1270](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1270): Modify the way block headers are retrieved from peers to be done in batches.

#### Breaking
- [#1279](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1279): Added a new CLI flag to enable the Relayer service `--enable-relayer`, and disabled the Relayer service by default. When supplying the `--enable-relayer` flag, the `--relayer` argument becomes mandatory, and omitting it is an error. Similarly, providing a `--relayer` argument without the `--enable-relayer` flag is an error. Lastly, providing the `--keypair` or `--network` arguments will also produce an error if the `--enable-p2p` flag is not set.
- [#1262](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1262): The `ConsensusParameters` aggregates all configuration data related to the consensus. It contains many fields that are segregated by the usage. The API of some functions was affected to use lesser types instead the whole `ConsensusParameters`. It is a huge breaking change requiring repetitively monotonically updating all places that use the `ConsensusParameters`. But during updating, consider that maybe you can use lesser types. Usage of them may simplify signatures of methods and make them more user-friendly and transparent.
- [#1290](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1290): Standardize CLI args to use `-` instead of `_`
