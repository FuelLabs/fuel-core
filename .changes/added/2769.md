Added a new `assembleTx` GraphQL endpoint.
The endpoint can be used to assemble the transaction based on the provided requirements.

The returned transaction contains:
- Input coins to cover `required_balances`
- Input coins to cover the fee of the transaction based on the gas price from `block_horizon`
- `Change` or `Destroy` outputs for all assets from the inputs
- `Variable` outputs in the case they are required during the execution
- `Contract` inputs and outputs in the case they are required during the execution
- Reserved witness slots for signed coins filled with `64` zeroes
- Set script gas limit(unless `script` is empty)
- Estimated predicates, if `estimate_predicates == true`

Returns an error if:
- The number of required balances exceeds the maximum number of inputs allowed.
- The fee address index is out of bounds.
- The same asset has multiple change policies(either the receiver of
    the change is different, or one of the policies states about the destruction
    of the token while the other does not). The `Change` output from the transaction
    also count as a `ChangePolicy`.
- The number of excluded coin IDs exceeds the maximum number of inputs allowed.
- Required assets have multiple entries.
- If accounts don't have sufficient amounts to cover the transaction requirements in assets.
- If a constructed transaction breaks the rules defined by consensus parameters.
