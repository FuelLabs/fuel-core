Added new P2P metrics `Functional_Peers_Connected` and `Reserved_Peers_Connected` to track application-level peer counts. These metrics reflect the number of peers in PeerManager, which may differ from libp2p's `peer_count_per_protocol` metric that counts connections at the transport/protocol level. This helps diagnose the discrepancy reported in issue #3011 and provides accurate peer counts for Grafana dashboards.
