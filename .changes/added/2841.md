Following endpoints allow estimation of predicates on submission of the transaction via new `estimatePredicates` argument:
- `submit`
- `submit_and_await`
- `submit_and_await_status`

The change is backward compatible with all SDKs. The change is not forward-compatible with Rust SDK in the case of the `estiamte_predicates` flag set.
