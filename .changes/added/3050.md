A new benchmarking group for `niop` operations in the `alu.rs` file. The changes add comprehensive benchmarks for various operations (`ADD`, `SUB`, `MUL`, `EXP`, `SLL`, `XNOR`) across different operand widths (`U8`, `U16`, `U32`)

### Additions to benchmarking:

* A new `niop` benchmarking group was added to evaluate the performance of narrow integer operations (`niop`) with different operand widths (`U8`, `U16`, `U32`).
* Introduced the `niop_bench` macro to simplify the creation of benchmarks for operations like `ADD`, `SUB`, `MUL`, `EXP`, `SLL`, and `XNOR`.
* Benchmarks iterate over generated operand pairs for each width, ensuring a variety of test cases for each operation.
