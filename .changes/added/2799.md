Add a transaction waiter to the executor to wait for potential new transactions inside the block production window.
Add a channel to send preconfirmation created by executor to the other modules
Added a new CLI arguments:
- `--production-timeout` to control the block production timeout in the case if block producer stuck.
- `--poa-open-period` set the block production mode to `Open`. The `Open` mode starts the production of the next block immediately after the previous block. The block is open until the `period` passed. The period is a duration represented by `100ms`, `1s`, `1m`, etc. The manual block production is disabled if this production mode is used.
