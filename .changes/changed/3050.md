Actualized benchmarks with the performance of the network. With this change we should be able to run benchmarks on nightly bases.

Added several optimizations to the code base:
- Executor now reuses the memory instance between blocks production and validation avoiding allocations.
- Receipts are not cloned anymore from the VM. Instead, they are extracted from the VM and stored ina s shared pointer.
- The gas usage for script is discovered in a faster way.
- `Create` transaction doesn't require a cloning of the contract bytecode anymore to calculate its `ContractId`.
- Serialization and deserialization of the bytes became much faster for canonical, `postcard`, `bincode` codecs.
