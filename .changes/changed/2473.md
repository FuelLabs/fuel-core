Graphql requests and responses make use of a new `extensions` object to specify request/response metadata. A request `extensions` object can contain an integer-valued `required_fuel_block_height` field. When specified, the request will return an error unless the node's current fuel block height is at least the value specified in the `required_fuel_block_height` field. All graphql responses now contain an integer-valued `current_fuel_block_height` field in the `extensions` object, which contains the block height of the last block processed by the node.
