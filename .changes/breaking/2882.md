Changed the type of the `resolved_outputs` for pre-confirmations. Now it also includes `Utxoid`. `resolved_outputs` field contains only `Change` and `Variable` outputs, so the `UtxoId` for them could be hard to derive, if transaction has known inputs. This information should help to create dependent transactions more easily.
