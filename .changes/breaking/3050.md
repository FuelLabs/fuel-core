- Used a new `fuel-vm 0.64.0` release which brings breaking changes: https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-vm/releases/tag/v0.64.0
- The default gas cost has been changed according to new optimizations and a new benchmark machine for a local node.
- Receipts now are behind an `Arc` pointer to avoid unnecessary cloning. It affects transaction states and preconfirmations.
- The `deploy_contract_with_id` now works with `[u8]` instead of the `Contract` type.
